# App Camp - LAB Electron

In this lab, we will package your application into an Electron container 

## Step 1: Build the App into electron directory 

* Type in to following command in your appcamp directory
```
sencha app build -des electron/app
```

Your directory structure should now look like this
```
appcamp/
├── app/
├── app.js
...
├── electron/
├── resources/
├── sass/
```

## Step 2: Creating a manifest file 

* If you are on macOS or linux and have NOT installed wine, please download this [package.json](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/shikhirsingh/a2bd9116b0c2418d065f3519592692a6/raw/780cc5ea97da422ae7a2884417d8e32a483cc9a4/package.json) file into appcamp/electron directory
* Otherwise, please download this [package.json](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/shikhirsingh/ae86d4b8c1735cf9cd19e23130612044/raw/de0496c96fc376b321428146706ec5998dbdaa93/package.json) file and put into the appcamp/electron directory

## Step 3: Creating a Main Process file
* Copy the [main.js](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/shikhirsingh/c690c39a690f63b69ab70a8b1f95bd78/raw/c427f8519eb2763113d88f664ece6589d761d6be/main.js) file and place it into the appcamp/electron/app directory

## Step 4: Installing Electron into your project

* Run the following command in the appcamp/electron directory from command prompt or terminal window 
```
npm install electron-prebuilt -save
```

## Step 5: Installing Electron Packager into your project

* Run the following command in the appcamp/electron directory
```
npm install electron-packager --save-dev
```

## Step 6: Running your Ext JS app inside Electron for the first time

* Run the following command 
```
npm start
```

## Step 7: Packaging for Release

* Once you are done progamming your application, you can create a production release build with the following command
```
npm run-script package
```
* After a few minutes, your release binaries will be available in the earthquakes/electron/dist directory

## Step 8: Share your binaries
* macOS builds are known as Darwin. Run your release build by double clicking on them
* Impress your friends - show them the app you build in this AppCamp by sharing the binary files!
